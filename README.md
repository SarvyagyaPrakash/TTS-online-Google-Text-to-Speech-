I created a Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that speaks text supplied by the user. It supports TTS engines both offline and online for accessibility and flexibility.

1. **TTS online (Google Text-to-Speech)**:
   - Text to speech is converted using Google TTS.
   - Translates into and supports a number of languages, including Russian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, French, German, English, and Spanish.
   - Permits speaking rate adjustment, giving users the ability to modify the generated speech's speed.

2. **Offline TTS with pyttsx3**:
   - This method makes use of the `pyttsx3} library to offer offline TTS capabilities.
   - Maps language codes to equivalent speech keywords, supporting the same range of languages.
   - Offers options to adjust the speech volume and rate, giving the user more control over the final product.

Conclusion:
The Text-to-Speech conversion application is a strong and adaptable tool with the ability to synthesize speech both offline and online, catering to a range of user requirements. 
The application is notable because of its:

1) Multi-Language Support: Because both TTS engines are multi-lingual, people with a variety of linguistic backgrounds can use it.
2) Customization: To make sure the generated speech satisfies their needs and tastes, users can change the speaking rate and volume.
3) Flexibility: The program may operate in a variety of settings, independent of an internet connection, thanks to the availability of both online (Google TTS) and offline (pyttsx3) possibilities.
   
All things considered, this TTS program provides a thorough method for turning text into clear speech, meeting both general and particular user needs with simplicity and
